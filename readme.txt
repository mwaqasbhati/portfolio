== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I add widgets? =

Revelar includes three widget areas, located underneath the main content. Configure these areas by going to Customizer > Widgets in your Dashboard.

= How to add a menu? =

Revelar comes with one Custom Menu in the header, which can be configured via Customizer â†’ Menus. This menu is hidden by default, and will not be displayed unless a Custom Menu is assigned.

= Does Revelar use featured images? =

Revelar makes us of Featured Images, which helps to visually tell your story. Featured Images are displayed below the title on the blog posts and archive pages. A smaller version of the image is used on the blog index page, where posts are displayed in a grid. For the optimal result, provide an image at least 1200px wide.

= Overhanging Images =

On a large monitor, left and right aligned images will overhang from the main column. Images that are 1200px or wider will be displayed edge-to-edge, filling all available width.

== Quick Specs (all measurements in pixels) ==

	1. The main column width is 800.
	2. A widget in the sidebar is 360.
	3. Featured Images work best with 1200 wide by 1000 high.
